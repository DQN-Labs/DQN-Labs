Hey! I'm a 15-year-old dev who lives and breathes Python and AI. My main obsession is **reinforcement learning**, so you'll find me working on RL agents, building fun games, and experimenting with Unity ML-Agents (and a little bit of C# when needed). Most of my free time? Yeah, it's coding time.

## 🏆 What I Do

- **Reinforcement Learning** — RL is my specialization! I code in Python, but I'm not afraid to jump into Unity ML-Agents for cool 3D experiments.
- **Python** — My main language and the star of most of my projects.
- **Unity ML-Agents** — Where Python meets Unity, and RL agents learn to play (or fight, or score goals). A place for me to showcase creative RL freedom.
- **C# (just a bit)** — Enough to wire up Unity with ML-Agents, but dont expect too much.
